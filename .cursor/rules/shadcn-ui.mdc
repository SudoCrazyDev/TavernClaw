# shadcn/ui — One UI Across the App

## Use shadcn/ui for All UI

- **Always use shadcn/ui components** for buttons, cards, forms, dialogs, tables, inputs, and layout in the app.
- Do not hand-roll custom equivalents (e.g. raw `<button>` or custom card markup) when a shadcn component exists.
- Add new shadcn components via the shadcn CLI when needed; keep them in `app/src/components/ui/`.

## Reusable Components Only

- **Single source of truth**: All shared UI lives under `app/src/components/`.
  - `app/src/components/ui/` — shadcn primitives (Button, Card, Dialog, Table, etc.).
  - `app/src/components/` — app-specific composites (e.g. InstanceCard, CreateInstanceDialog) that use only `ui/` components.
- **No duplicate UI patterns**: If a pattern repeats (e.g. a card with title + description + action), extract it into a reusable component in `app/src/components/` and use it everywhere.
- **Pages use components**: Pages in `app/src/pages/` should compose components from `app/src/components/` and `app/src/components/ui/`, not inline one-off markup.

## Conventions

- Import from `@/components/ui/` (or the project alias) for shadcn components.
- Keep shadcn component files as installed; override appearance via props or Tailwind in the parent, not by editing `ui/` files unless intentional theming.
- Prefer composition: build app components from small shadcn building blocks so the UI stays consistent across Home, Dashboard, Instances, and future routes.
